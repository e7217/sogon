## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
Users currently can only transcribe audio using external API services (OpenAI, Groq), which creates several constraints:

1. **Network Dependency**: Requires stable internet connection and external service availability
2. **API Costs**: Ongoing costs for transcription API usage
3. **Data Privacy**: Audio files must be sent to external services
4. **Latency**: Network round-trip time adds to processing duration
5. **Rate Limits**: Subject to API provider rate limiting and quotas
6. **Vendor Lock-in**: Dependent on specific API provider availability and pricing

### User Impact
- **Cost-sensitive users**: Cannot control or reduce transcription costs
- **Privacy-conscious users**: Cannot guarantee data stays on their infrastructure
- **Offline users**: Cannot transcribe without internet connectivity
- **High-volume users**: Face rate limiting and quota restrictions
- **Enterprise users**: Cannot deploy fully on-premises solutions

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-17
- Q: Should the system automatically download Whisper models when first requested, or require users to manually download them before use? → A: Auto-download on first use - System automatically downloads model from Hugging Face when user first requests it (with progress feedback)
- Q: What should happen when the system runs out of memory (RAM) or VRAM during local model inference? → A: Fail with error - Stop transcription immediately and display clear error message with memory requirements
- Q: Are all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) required for initial release, or can we phase them? → A: Linux first, phased expansion - Initial release supports Linux only, followed by macOS and Windows in subsequent releases
- Q: Should the system check available disk space before attempting model download/loading? → A: Proactive check - System checks available disk space before download and provides clear error with space requirements if insufficient
- Q: Should hardware capability detection and recommendation be automatic or triggered by user request? → A: Use predefined defaults - No automatic hardware detection, system uses predefined default configuration (CPU device, base model) that users can manually override
- Q: What is the maximum number of concurrent local transcription jobs? Should this be configurable? → A: Configurable limit - Default maximum of 2 concurrent jobs, user-configurable via environment variable or CLI flag
- Q: When should loaded models be evicted from memory? LRU policy? Maximum cache size? → A: LRU eviction policy - Use Least Recently Used policy with configurable maximum cache size to automatically manage memory

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **user with GPU hardware**, I want to **transcribe audio files using a locally-loaded Whisper model** so that **I can process audio without internet connectivity, reduce API costs, and maintain data privacy**.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the user has installed sogon with local model dependencies, **When** they configure the system to use a local Whisper model and transcribe an audio file, **Then** the transcription completes successfully using the local model without any external API calls.

2. **Given** the user has a GPU-capable machine, **When** they configure local transcription with GPU acceleration, **Then** the transcription uses GPU resources and completes faster than CPU-only processing.

3. **Given** the user has existing workflows using API-based transcription, **When** they upgrade to a version with local model support, **Then** their existing configurations continue to work without modification.

4. **Given** the user has limited disk space, **When** they attempt to use a large local model without sufficient storage, **Then** the system provides a clear error message indicating storage requirements.

5. **Given** the user has local model enabled, **When** an error occurs during local inference, **Then** the system provides actionable error messages with suggested resolutions.

6. **Given** the user wants to switch between API and local models, **When** they change the transcription provider configuration, **Then** the system seamlessly switches between providers without requiring code changes.

7. **Given** the user transcribes the same audio with both API and local models, **When** comparing the results, **Then** both outputs have consistent timestamp formats and metadata structure.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user specifies a local model that doesn't exist or isn't downloaded?
- System immediately stops and displays error with memory requirements when running out of RAM/VRAM during inference
- What occurs when the user's GPU drivers are incompatible or outdated?
- How does the system behave when switching from local to API mid-processing?
- What happens if the local model file is corrupted or incomplete?
- How does the system handle very large audio files with limited GPU memory?

## Open Questions for Clarification

1. **Performance Targets** (NFR-001, NFR-002): What are specific acceptable performance targets for GPU vs CPU and model loading times?

2. **VAD Integration** (Out of Scope): Should Voice Activity Detection be included to improve efficiency and accuracy?

3. **Actionability Measurement** (Success Criteria): How do we objectively measure that error messages are "actionable" and documentation resolves issues?

4. **Model Selection Guidance**: Should the system provide interactive guidance to help users choose appropriate model size based on their hardware?
